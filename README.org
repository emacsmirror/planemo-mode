This package provides a minor mode for developing tool wrappers for the [[https://galaxyproject.eu/][GalaxyProject]], which makes use of a [[https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/schema.html][specific XML-based schema]] in conjunction with the [[https://cheetahtemplate.org/][Cheetah template engine]]. 

The mode brings Bash and Cheetah fontification (inspired by the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CheetahMode][Cheetah Mode]] in the Emacs Wiki) and indentation functions.

** Installation

Install from MELPA or using =use-package=:

   #+begin_src elisp
     (use-package planemo-mode
       :mode ("\\.xml\\'")) ;; bind the mode to the XML extension
   #+end_src

** Usage

Open a Galaxy XML file such as those hosted on [[https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/blob/master/tools/table_compute/table_compute.xml][tools-iuc]] and notice that the fontification extends beyond the XML but into the command and config sections.

Pressing =TAB= on a given line or on a selected region will indent the line or region. The indentation rules emulate Python indentation, but allow more flexibility: non-Cheetah terms can be aligned to be nested under an opening =if= or =for= statement, or flush with them, or at position 0. This provides users with the ability to ensure that the code after the templating does not have inconsistent spacing (such as R scripts).

The indentation logic was complex to implement, but actually follows some simple rules:

1. Do normal =nxml= indentation if within an XML section.
2. Python Indent all Cheetah tags (e.g. =#if=, =#for=, =#else=, etc.)
3. The first non-Cheetah line under a Cheetah tag provides flexible indents (nest, flush, 0) as describe in the above paragraph.
4. All other lines align to the line above

** Customisation

*** Keywords

The following keywords are fontified and can be customized by setting the variable.

| VarName             | Description                               | Default Value                                              |
|---------------------+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| =planemo--python-ops= | Python operations used by Cheetah         | "or" "and" "in" "+" "-" "*" "/" "==" "!="                    |
| =planemo--python-fun= | Python functions used by Cheetah          | "enumerate" "str" "int" "open"                             |
| =planemo--bash-comms= | Bash commands commonly found in the XML   | "cat" "head" "tail" "awk" "cut" "ls" "grep" "echo" "touch" |
| =planemo--bash-ops=   | Bash operations commonly found in the XML | "&&" ">" "<" ">>" "<<" " \vert "                           |

e.g. To highlight only the specific bash and python commands that we want, we can override the keywords with the example config below

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package planemo-mode
    :mode ("\\.xml\\'")
    :config
    (setq planemo--bash-comms '("Rscript" "python" "gawk")
          planemo--python-fun '("enumerate" "lambda" )))
#+end_src


*** Colours

   For theme consistency, the font-faces are locked to the default font-lock faces, and users should switch themes or modify their default font faces should they wish to change the colouring of the fontified terms.
